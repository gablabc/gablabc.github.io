This paper demonstrates the possibility of **cherry picking** the data samples provided to SHAP in
order to change the global feature importance. The specific use-case presented concerns a model
audit where a company has to convince an auditor that the disparities in model outcome among
protected subgroups are caused by *meritocratic* features.
