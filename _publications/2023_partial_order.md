This paper tackles the challenge of deriving insights from post-hoc explanations of
ML models, given the existence of an infinite set of models with good empirical
performance. It is proposed to take a consensus on the local/global feature importance across all
models from the Rashomon Set to provide **partial orders** of feature importance.
